      "I spent my 9th grade work practise program in Helsinki. My work at Lundén was very diverse in nature: I got to try out quality assurance work, familiarized myself with different kinds of software commonly used in the field, such as Slack, ArchiCad and Adobe InDesign, and interviewed the other employees about their work. It was a very valuable experience that taught me a lot about workplace culture.",
