          <p>
            I’m an ICT and software development student at OSAO, currently in my
            second year, though I’ve had a passion for programming since I was
            10 years old. At school, I specialize in software development, but
            I’ve also dabbled in web design & development, machine learning
            methodologies, and 3D modelling, as well as unit testing through my
            internship at Nokia. In addition to programming, I’m interested in
            illustration and UI/UX design.
