      "Talvimetsä is a 2D platformer game that I designed and developed myself. I also made all the assets from scratch, from the tilemaps to the sprite animations and UI design. The game was developed with Unity using C# and took me around 2 months to complete. I wanted to keep the premise and mechanics of the game rather simple, as it was my first time using Unity for game development and I was still getting used to the features. On top of normal the typical W-D-space movement and jumping, I also implemented a gravity reversal mechanic that the game’s level design is centred around. There’s a lives system, cooldown timer, checkpoints and collectable items scattered around the map as well. The game is set in a night-time forest at winter that eventually opens into an icy cavern.",

      "Exodus is a 3D survival-puzzle-horror game developed as a group project by me and my classmate Milo Koskela. We both did our part in programming the logic of the game, but I also worked on the UI, inventory mechanics, puzzle design and 3D modelling. The game was developed with Unity using C# and took around 3 months to complete.",

      "A retro arcade game-style shooter built on the 2D engine Pygame but rendered with 3D graphics. The game code is entirely in Python. The game was built to run on a Raspberry Pi and require no controller or mouse to play – it’s instead controlled with mediapipe’s gesture recognition. The game was developed as a group project. I programmed game mechanics like player movement, hand tracking, score counting and the game loop, but also created enemy graphics and built the UI. I also took on the role of project manager, taking care of our backlog and sprint boards and upkeeping communication between team members. Having to code everything from scratch instead of using a highly sophisticated engine like Unity was a refreshing experience. I'm now much more confident in my Python skills.",

      "For 2024, I decided to build an updated version of my portfolio from scratch using React. My main focus for this project was on responsiveness, and my goal was to make the page look good on devices of all shapes and sizes, while still managing to display my skills and giving me a place to showcase my interest in web design. I started using Git for version management from the get-go and created the base for the application using create-react-app. Learning React was a fun challenge, but it definitely improved my understanding of page structure and flow. Building the portfolio itself took about 3 weeks.",
