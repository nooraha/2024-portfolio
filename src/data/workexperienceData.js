      "I spent my 9th grade work practise program in Helsinki. My work at Lundén was very diverse in nature: I got to try out quality assurance work, familiarized myself with different kinds of software commonly used in the field, such as Slack, ArchiCad and Adobe InDesign, and interviewed the other employees about their work. It was a very valuable experience that taught me a lot about workplace culture.",

      "At Nokia, I worked as part of a CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) subteam for three months from the beginning of June to the end of August. I'm told I got hang of work very quickly for a summer trainee. My work mostly covered things like designing test cases, building unit test files and refactoring old code. I started out with just Python but learned C++ while working. I also learned a lot about unit testing, clean code, version control and programming in general. I also got to experience working in an environment with Agile and Scrum methodologies. As me and my team worked using a hybrid, mostly work-from-home model, we communicated mainly through Teams.",

      "I worked for Iso Ilo for a period of two weeks as part of an on-the-job learning program to progress my studies. Managing my time efficiently was essential as I also had to attend upper secondary school classes during my employment period. I received a list of proposed changes and updates for the isoilo.fi website, but also gave suggestions myself for things like implementing a content management system to make updating the website easier in the future. I mainly worked with the tools provided by Wix but also used some JavaScript. I worked independently, but also communicated with Iso Ilo through regular meetings to update them on my progress.",
