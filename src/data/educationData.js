      "In lower secondary school, I was part of a class with an art-weighed curriculum, meaning more focus on art than a regular class. The range of techniques available and taught was great, including ones like acrylic, gouache, watercolor and oil painting, drawing with pencils and alcohol-based markers, sculpture as well as photography. Some of the skills I learned were expressing my inner thoughts through art and collaboration with others on a piece.",

      "I've been taking flute lessons at the Oulu Conservatory since age 6. My studies there have also included 5 years' worth of music theory, performing in concerts and participating in orchestra activity. I completed the basic studies encompassing 800 hours of music education in spring of 2022 and started advanced studies the following fall. In 2023, I also started playing the tenor saxophone as a side instrument. I've played the flute at many school events and have no problem with performing in front of an audience.",

      "I completed the Elements of AI and Building AI University of Helsinki online courses during spring in the first year of my studies at OSAO. The Elements of AI course gave me a good understanding of what AI really is and the many ways it can be used, while Building AI equipped me with the skills necessary to try programming AI applications myself. I completed the course exercises on Advanced difficulty, meaning I actually had to write the code myself. While I'm still definitely no expert, I now have a good working foundation and understanding of concepts like the Bayes Rule, linear and logistic regression, the nearest neighbor method as well as neural networks.",
